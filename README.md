# Tic Tac Toe - A React App
Following the [Intro to React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) for my first react project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Playing the game

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Running the Tests

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
